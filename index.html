      At the University of California, Riverside, I started a new life that took on an adventure for the first time with me and myself. I began as a newbie who had generally no idea regarding any principles about college life and a freshman who suffered disdain from upper-class students. That being said, my life at the University of California, Riverside, was an excessive but also meaningful challenge. 
	In the past quarter, I met new situations and confronted new difficulties as the difference between college life and high school life had a wide gap. It all started in the event that impacted my life since seventh grade in middle school, which changed my life totally. The thought of coming to university was never an approachable goal for me at that time, and the expectations from parents had also never expected me to go to a state university not even talking about the brand of the University of California. That day, I came to the United States of America to join a brand new country and community. I was a kid who could just spell English letters correctly and could barely speak a few sentences. In the English Language Development program, I spent my two years in struggling through the language barrier, and those two years also represented that I wasted two years in emptiness. Although math was not a challenge for me, Math for seventh graders and eighth graders was practically equating one plus one to me. However, wasting time to utilize academic knowledge from the past prevented me to move on to learn new stuff. Except for learning the fact that I wasted my two years and the enlightenment that I shall become better in academics and general life, I learned literally nothing. When I started my high school career in the ninth grade, I came to the conclusion that I need to prepare for college or otherwise, expectations that would fail with my parents, disdain that I would receive from other relatives stating that I was useless and my parentsâ€™ goal sending me to the United States of America was a failure, and hopelessness that I would suffer for the rest of my life being a useless garbage. Ultimately, this future did not disappoint me, I was admitted to the University of California, Riverside. 

<br><br>

        That being said, my first impression walking on the campus of the University of California, Riverside, was bold, proud, and exciting. I took classes such as Chass Humanities First-Year Learning Communities, Math 009B, Basic Writing Class for Second Language, and Business 010. Those classes make me the man who is writing this essay right now, both being proud and happy. Starting this quarter, except for Math 009B allowed me to pass easily even using the cell phone in class still got me a one hundred percent on the midterm, Basic Writing class for second language students was the biggest challenge for me. Unlike normal English class, the instructor literally suppresses students and forced students to confront harsh academic pressure, which included massive homework, harsh grading scale, and bad teaching style combined with a bad personality. On the first day of this English class, the instructor literally told us that he only expected thirty percent of our twenty people class to pass. If I was doing the math correctly, only six students would end up passing before the end of this quarter and a large percentage of students are going to retake this class suffering at the same hell with probably a more difficult instructor. That was the first time in my life that forced me to pursue a better grade; I went to the instructorsâ€™ office hours begging him to give any suggestions for me to raise up the essay score. He told me that I should first show the specific details, second explained the significance, and lastly asserted back the relevance to the topic sentence. Suddenly, I came to enlightenment which for the past several years I did not realize that English essay was no more than fitting the blank. Instead of thinking about what to write struggling for the problem of how to finish my essay because I did not know what to write, the main focus should be concentrating on which stuff to write such that I could get a better grade and fit the instructor's appetite. When the essay came out, I was announced as the best essay in the classroom which I received an eighty-eight percent as the top of the class. Though I still have no idea about what is the highest score the instructor could give, I was proud and relieved because I was top of the class. 
	Not talking about taking difficult classes in college life academically, the second challenge for me was how to fit into the social classes in universities and how to be happy with myself overall. I am a gym person who use to have exercises about six times per week before coming to the University of California, Riverside. That being said, I needed to organize a time schedule that would allow me to go to the gym while not affecting the different time schedule from college life. Instead of going to the gym every day after three PM, now I have to have a fittable time among classes which result in me to go to the gym sometimes around noon, sometimes in the afternoon, and sometimes at midnight. Despite gym workouts, I was overwhelmingly concerned about how to fit into college social circles. Luckily, I met several good people at the beginning of this quarter, they introduced me to their circles allowing me to get to know more people.
